Project: Grade Management System Using Python Programming<br/>

Objective:<br/>
The objective of this project is to develop a Python-based system that allows teachers to manage student grades effectively. The system will store student details, handle grade input, and calculate the overall grade for each student.

Key Activities:<br/>
Student Record Management: Stores student information such as name, ID, and the list of grades for each course.
Grade Input: Accepts and processes grades for individual students in various subjects.
Grade Calculation: Computes the overall grade for each student, allowing teachers to generate a summary of student performance.
Search and Display: Provides functionality to search for a specific student and display their grades and overall performance.

Technologies Used:<br/>
Python 3.11.5: The primary programming language used to develop the grade management system.
File Handling (CSV or JSON): Employed to store and retrieve student data from external files, ensuring data persistence.
Exception Handling: Applied to manage input errors and ensure smooth operation during grade entry and calculations.
Notepad/IDE: Used as a text editor or integrated development environment (IDE) for writing Python code.
Command Prompt/Terminal: Utilized to run the Python program and interact with the grade management system.

Key Insights:<br/>
User-Friendly Interface: Provides a simple command-line interface for easy input of student data and grades.
Modular Design: Employs object-oriented programming to structure the system into classes and methods, promoting reusability and ease of maintenance.
Data Persistence: Utilizes file handling techniques to save and retrieve student records, ensuring that data is not lost between sessions.
Efficient Calculations: Handles the calculation of grade averages, allowing teachers to quickly view student performance.
Error Handling: Implements exception handling to manage invalid input data, ensuring the system remains operational during errors.

Conclusion:<br/>
The Grade Management System demonstrates Python's capabilities in object-oriented programming, file handling, and exception management. It effectively simplifies the process of storing, managing, and calculating student grades. The system can be further enhanced by adding features like graphical interfaces or more complex grading criteria in the future.
